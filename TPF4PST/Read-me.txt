The application is intended to be used to some specific contingencies which started affecting the spacecraft recently, due, most likely, to the wear out of the electronic circuits making up the hardware of the on-board computer. Namely, it has been found that in case of certain anomalies on board, a re-allocation of the bandwidth for the programmable slots of the PST can help to regain control of Integral.
The objective is to offer an intuitive tool to quickly generate a particular TPF containing the programmable slots of the PST. 
This application generates a TPF which can be loaded on the manual stack and uplinked to the CDMU of the spacecraft to regulate the bus activities and the flow of telemetries and commands from and to the packet terminals and RTUs as well as the planning of other activities such as patch and dump of memory.
