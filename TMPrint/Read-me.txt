This work is intended to optimise the work of some engineers of the FCT by  automating the telemetry analysis for the AOCS subsystem in particular. 
This won’t be a real-time operation, but it’s very useful in assessing the performance of a new software patch which is to be loaded onboard.

The software processes, organizes and displays some sets of telemetry parameters in order to allow the engineers to perform an analysis of the data retrieved 
from the simulated spacecraft and plan some new operation command sequences to face the need for a more efficient and reliable procedure to slew the spacecraft. 

In order to introduce new slewing sequences that use the gyroscopes onboard (previously the gyroscopes were not active for slewing) a change to the onboard 
software has to be performed. Pandas was used to perform some smart post-processing and convert the input data in a data-frame structure. 
Matplotlib was used to display the results and save the .png images. On the plots, vertical lines are also shown to underline the start and end of slew 
and when applicable, the abort of the slew abort, which corresponds to the moment the slew abort command is received (which doesn’t happen in every simulation).
